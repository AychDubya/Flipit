# Project_2_FlipIt!
Welcome to FlipIt! Brought to you by Andrew, Hannibal (gitmaster), Derek and Mike (project manager).
FlipIt is an interactive flashcard app where users will create an account then sign in to study flashcards covering material from a variety of subjects. 
We wanted to build a stylish app for knowledge using flashcards, a highly effective study tool. This app is intended for use by students but ANYONE can benefit from it! 
Our MVP for this project was to create an application that will: 1) Allow users to create a profile, 2) allow users to create decks which they can add cards to, and 3) Allow users to search by deck name. When they create account, users will receive a welcome email in their inbox with a message containing a link to the deployed site where they can begin the FlipIt experience
After the user logs in, they are taken to their account page and greeted by “Hello (username)” text in the header, where they can create a new deck or delete their account. While they create a new deck, a box appears to let the user input the deck name and select a subject. The user is also given the option to make the deck public with a checkbox in the lower right-hand side of the screen. 
After clicking create, the empty deck appears in the bottom of the container. 
Clicking “study” allows users to review the flashcards. “View” allows them to create new flashcards for the deck. And… “Delete” allows the user to delete the deck if they are no longer using it. The newly created deck will now be searchable on the main page…. if the user opted to make it public. Once the user has created their deck, and wants to see the wonderful team who created the app, they can click on “Dev Team” on the top nav bar for a brief bio of our team.
From the main page, the user may search for a public flashcard deck to study by clicking on a suggestion box or search manually using the search field and dropdown box. They can also create an account or sign into an existing one for a more personalized experience.
